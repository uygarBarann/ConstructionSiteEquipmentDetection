Please note that the YOLOv8 model results can be found in the "results_from_training" folder. 
This model was trained using data from Roboflow. 

The project's goal is to detect specific objects in any construction site image and save them in a separate file. 
Additionally, we aim to identify objects related to the excavation site in any video and capture one frame per second. These detected objects will be output as a new video.
